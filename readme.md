# P4

## Description of the project: 
I created an Event Management System for a small event planning company I hope to launch
in the upcoming year, Parties on Pennies. Users can register or log in to use this system 
to manage their upcoming parties. They can add, view, edit, and delete events. In addition, they can add guests to each event, view the guest list, edit a guest, and delete a guest. 

## Demo information: 
I  demoed p4 in Jeremy's 7:30-9pm virtual class on Wednesday, December 17.

## Additional info:
I had originally hoped to add a lot more functionality (emailing users, lost password recovery, autofilling forms, etc.) and make it look a little nicer, but given the unfortunate incident of the stolen computer, I was a bit pressed for time. However, I am very excited to work on this in the upcoming months and launch my site later this year. Thanks so much for all your help and guidance this semester! It was an excellent class!
